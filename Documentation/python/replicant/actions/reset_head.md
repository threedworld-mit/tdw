# ResetHead

`from tdw.replicant.actions.reset_head import ResetHead`

Reset the head to its neutral rotation.

The head will continuously move over multiple `communicate()` calls until it is at its neutral rotation.

***

## Fields

- `duration` The duration of the motion in seconds.

- `status` [The current status of the action.](../action_status.md) By default, this is `ongoing` (the action isn't done).

- `initialized` If True, the action has initialized. If False, the action will try to send `get_initialization_commands(resp)` on this frame.

- `done` If True, this action is done and won't send any more commands.

- `status` [The current status of the action.](../action_status.md) By default, this is `ongoing` (the action isn't done).

- `initialized` If True, the action has initialized. If False, the action will try to send `get_initialization_commands(resp)` on this frame.

- `done` If True, this action is done and won't send any more commands.

#### \_\_init\_\_

**`ResetHead(duration)`**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| duration |  float |  | The duration of the motion in seconds. |

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| resp |  List[bytes] |  | The response from the build. |
| static |  ReplicantStatic |  | The [`ReplicantStatic`](../replicant_static.md) data that doesn't change after the Replicant is initialized. |
| dynamic |  ReplicantDynamic |  | The [`ReplicantDynamic`](../replicant_dynamic.md) data that changes per `communicate()` call. |
| image_frequency |  ImageFrequency |  | An [`ImageFrequency`](../../image_frequency.md) value describing how often image data will be captured. |

_Returns:_  A list of commands to initialize this action.

#### get_ongoing_commands

**`self.get_ongoing_commands(resp, static, dynamic)`**

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| resp |  List[bytes] |  | The response from the build. |
| static |  ReplicantStatic |  | The [`ReplicantStatic`](../replicant_static.md) data that doesn't change after the Replicant is initialized. |
| dynamic |  ReplicantDynamic |  | The [`ReplicantDynamic`](../replicant_dynamic.md) data that changes per `communicate()` call. |

_Returns:_  A list of commands to send to the build to continue the action.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| resp |  List[bytes] |  | The response from the build. |
