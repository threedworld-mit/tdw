        :param audio_filename: The name of the audio file that plays when the user applies force.
        :param random_seed: The random seed. Can be null. If null, the seed is random.
        :param time: The total time in seconds that the user has to click the object.
        :param scene_name: The name of the scene.
        :param table_names: A list of names of table models. One of these will be randomly selected and added to the scene.
        :param model_names: A list of names of models that can be randomly added to the table.
        :param target_object_names: An array of target object model names. A random target object will be chosen from this array per trial.
        :param target_object_ui_texts: An array of target object model names as they will be displayed in UI text.
        :param table_position_perturbation: The table will be at a random position relative to (0, 0, 0). The position is calculated by getting a random position in a circle. The radius of the circle is between 0 and this value. Set this to 0 if you want the table to always be at (0, 0, 0).
        :param rotate_table: A value between 0 and 1 that defines the probability that the table will be rotated 90 degrees.

        :param avatar_distance: The avatar will initially be at a distance from the table defined by these two values (min, max).
        :param avatar_perturbation: The avatar's position will be perturbed by a factor between 0 and this value, in meters.
        :param avatar_rotation: When the avatar is spawned, it will look at the center of the table and then turn between -avatar_rotation and avatar_rotation degrees.
        :param font_size: The font size.
        :param font_color: The font color.

        :param model_position_step: Step each table position by this distance.
        :param model_position_perturbation: Perturb each table position by this factor.
        :param framerate: The target framerate.
        :param render_quality: The render quality (0 to 5, where 5 is best).
