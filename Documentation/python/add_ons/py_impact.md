# PyImpact

`from tdw.add_ons.py_impact import PyImpact`

**PyImpact has been deprecated. Use [`Clatter`](clatter.md) instead.**

Generate impact sounds from physics data. Sounds can be synthesized automatically (for general use-cases) or manually (for advanced use-cases).

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller
from tdw.tdw_utils import TDWUtils
from tdw.add_ons.audio_initializer import AudioInitializer
from tdw.add_ons.py_impact import PyImpact

c = Controller()
commands = [TDWUtils.create_empty_room(12, 12)]
commands.extend(TDWUtils.create_avatar(avatar_id="a",
                                       position={"x": 1, "y": 1.6, "z": -2},
                                       look_at={"x": 0, "y": 0.5, "z": 0}))
commands.extend(c.get_add_physics_object(model_name="vase_02",
                                         position={"x": 0, "y": 3, "z": 0},
                                         object_id=c.get_unique_id()))
audio_initializer = AudioInitializer(avatar_id="a")
py_impact = PyImpact()
c.add_ons.extend([audio_initializer, py_impact])
c.communicate(commands)
for i in range(200):
    c.communicate([])
c.communicate({"$type": "terminate"})

    abstract = {<p>Contact between rigid-body objects produces a diversity of impact and friction sounds. These sounds can be synthesized with detailed simulations of the motion, vibration and sound radiation of the objects, but such synthesis is computationally expensive and prohibitively slow for many applications. Moreover, detailed physical simulations may not be necessary for perceptually compelling synthesis; humans infer ecologically relevant causes of sound, such as material categories, but not with arbitrary precision. We present a generative model of impact sounds which summarizes the effect of physical variables on acoustic features via statistical distributions fit to empirical measurements of object acoustics. Perceptual experiments show that sampling from these distributions allows efficient synthesis of realistic impact and scraping sounds that convey material, mass, and motion.</p>

#### get_initialization_commands

**`self.get_initialization_commands()`**

This function gets called exactly once per add-on. To re-initialize, set `self.initialized = False`.

_Returns:_  A list of commands that will initialize this add-on.

#### on_send

**`self.on_send(resp)`**

This is called within `Controller.communicate(commands)` after commands are sent to the build and a response is received.

Use this function to send commands to the build on the next `Controller.communicate(commands)` call, given the `resp` response.
Any commands in the `self.commands` list will be sent on the *next* `Controller.communicate(commands)` call.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| resp |  List[bytes] |  | The response from the build. |

#### before_send

**`self.before_send(commands)`**

This is called within `Controller.communicate(commands)` before sending commands to the build. By default, this function doesn't do anything.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| commands |  List[dict] |  | The commands that are about to be sent to the build. |

#### get_early_initialization_commands

**`self.get_early_initialization_commands()`**

This function gets called exactly once per add-on. To re-initialize, set `self.initialized = False`.

These commands are added to the list being sent on `communicate()` *before* any other commands, including those added by the user and by other add-ons.

Usually, you shouldn't override this function. It is useful for a small number of add-ons, such as loading screens, which should initialize before anything else.
