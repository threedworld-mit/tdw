    Controller add-ons can be "attached" to any controller to add functionality into the `communicate()` function.

    Add-ons work by reading the response from the build and building a list of commands to be sent on the next `Controller.communicate(commands)` call.
    Anything that add-ons do can be replicated elsewhere via the TDW Command API, which means that these add-ons don't provide _additional_ functionality to TDW; rather, they are utility objects for commonly required tasks such as image capture.

    We recommend that new TDW users use add-ons in their controllers, while more experienced users might prefer to have more fine-grained control. Add-ons are a new feature in TDW as of v1.9.0 and we're still in the process of updating our example controllers.

    ## Usage

    To attach an add-on, append it to the `add_ons` list.
    Every time `Controller.communicate(commands)` is called, the add-on will evaluate the response from the build via `on_send(resp)`. The add-on can send additional commands to the build on the next frame or do something within its own state (such as update an ongoing log):

    ```python
    from tdw.controller import Controller
    from tdw.add_ons.logger import Logger

    c = Controller(launch_build=False)
    logger = Logger(record=True, path="log.json")
    c.add_ons.append(logger)
    # The logger add-on will log this command.
    c.communicate({"$type": "do_nothing"})
    # The logger add-on will log this command and generate a log.json file.
    c.communicate({"$type": "terminate"})
    ```
