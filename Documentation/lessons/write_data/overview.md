##### Write Data

# Overview

In many cases, TDW re-structures [output data](../core_concepts/output_data.md) from the build such that it is readily serializable. TDW also includes several options for serializing data and writing it to disk.

## Pre-created writers vs. custom writers

**The data writers described in this lesson are not the only means of writing data.** Because TDW projects vary so widely, TDW has been designed to make data writing easy, and many projects write data differently (and write different data). The options described in this lesson are often great starting points, especially for testing, but might not be the best fit for all use cases. [This document offers some tips for how to create custom data writers.](custom_writers.md)

## Topics covered elsewhere

Some of these options are described within this lesson and some are not. These options are described elsewhere:

- [Images](../core_concepts/images.md) (in "Core Concepts")
- [Audio](../audio/overview.md) (in "Audio")
- [Video](../video/overview.md) (in "Video Recording")
