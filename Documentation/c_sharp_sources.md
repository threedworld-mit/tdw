The public release of TDW contains all Python code, full documentation and binary executable “builds” of the simulation engine for Linux, OSX and Windows.  However we have chosen not to release the C# source code for the TDW back-end and other underlying aspects pf the platform. Our reasoning is this: TDW has been carefully designed so that the vast majority of use-cases should not require access to any back-end components of the platform. The Python code has been designed so any researcher can work with it easily, and so we can easily support it and accept contributions. The underlying C# components of TDW, on the other hand, require significant low-level programming experience with Unity and advanced C# development in general. However as long as the C# code is closed-source, we can choose to add powerful third-party plugins and accelerate the development of new features.

In summary, we hope and expect that most users will be able to get full value from TDW using the publicly released Python code and simulation engine executables.

However, we do recognize that certain users may need to, or want to, make modifications to the underlying C# code to suit specialized use cases. We therefore plan to consider applications for access to the back-end C# source code and Unity project on a case-by-case basis.  If you feel you absolutely need the C# source code for your desired use case of TDW, then before applying please read carefully the FAQ document located at XXXX.  Please make sure that you a) meet the requirements as outlined in that document regarding Unity and C# development experience (we cannot support non-experts using the C# code); and b) understand and accept that we may be much slower to respond to code contributions or queries on this repo compared to the public one, due to our constrained engineering resources.

If after reading the document you still feel your use case will require access to the underlying C# code, apply for access by contacting Jeremy Schwartz at [jeremyes@mit.edu](mailto:jeremyes@mit.edu) , describing your use case and why you feel it necessary to have access. We will be happy to discuss your situation with you and will fully consider your application.

Please note that access to the TDW C# sources does NOT include access to the “Full” 3D model library, as described on the TDW web site and in our documentation:  https://github.com/threedworld-mit/tdw/blob/v1.6.0.4/Documentation/misc_frontend/models_full.md. We are still exploring the idea of making that model library generally available; you can help us understand the level of interest in the library by taking the brief survey on our web site at this link: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeJGR_PXlVRwOis9dcM2SDwP3Jcuf78Yo0TLmgLWLpuQI9Xig/viewform
