##### Scene Setup (Low-Level APIs)

# Overview

This sub-section of the "scene setup" guide covers TDW's low-level scene setup APIs.

As with everything else in TDW, APIs at any level are composed of commands and output data. [`ProcGenKitchen`](../scene_setup_high_level/proc_gen_kitchen.md), for example, is a complex add-on, but it doesn't do anything that a very dedicated user couldn't code on their own.

For simple scenes, most users will want to create their own scene setup procedures. Nearly all of TDW's example controllers do this in some manner. This sub-section will explain some useful scene setup tools not documented elsewhere.
