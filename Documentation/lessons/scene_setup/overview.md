##### Objects and Scenes

# Overview

These lessons will cover the basics of how to populate a [scene](../core_concepts/scenes.md) with [objects](../core_concepts/objects.md). The documentation for this section is subdivided into two "lesson tracks":

1. **[Scene Setup (high-level API)](../scene_setup_high_level/overview.md)** describes TDW's high-level built-in scene setup recipes and generators and how to use them.
2. **[Scene Setup (low-level API)](../scene_setup_low_level/overview.md)** describes commonly-used tools for creating your own custom scene setup.

If you're new to TDW, we recommend trying to use the high-level APIs first and learning more about the low-level APIs as-needed. TDW is designed to be easily extended, and you may find that it is easiest to create sub-classes of pre-existing scene setup classes that use your own lower-level custom code, rather than programming a whole new process.

That said, we expect all users to be able to use the low-level scene setup API; users who have some background in 3D graphics or game design in particular may prefer the low-level API options.
