        :param avatar_directions: The avatar can spawn at any of these compass directions from the table.
        :param avatar_distance: The avatar will initially be at a distance from the table defined by these two values (min, max).
        :param avatar_perturbation: The avatar's position will be perturbed by a factor between 0 and this value, in meters.
        :param avatar_rotation: When the avatar is spawned, it will look at the center of the table and then turn between -avatar_rotation and avatar_rotation degrees.

        :param font_size: The font size.
        :param framerate: The target framerate.
        :param model_names: A list of names of models that can be randomly added to the table.
        :param model_position_perturbation: Perturb each table position by this factor.

        :param table_position_perturbation: The table will be at a random position relative to (0, 0, 0). The position is calculated by getting a random position in a circle. The radius of the circle is between 0 and this value. Set this to 0 if you want the table to always be at (0, 0, 0).
