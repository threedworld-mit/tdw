##### Non-physics objects

# Textured quads

**Textured quads** are simple rectangular objects that exist in 3D space and be set to any given [texture](../objects_and_scenes/materials_textures_colors.md). These 3D "quads" can be positioned and set to an image located on your computer. 

Textured quads can be used to visualize areas in a scene, add paintings to walls, increase overall scene variability, and so on.

To add a textured quad to the scene, we must first load the source image. We will use this image:

![](images/DT4897.jpg)

We'll load it like any other binary file in Python. To send it to TDW, the bytes need to be converted to a base 64 string:

```python
from base64 import b64encode

input_image_path = "DT4897.jpg"
# Open the image and encode it to base 64.
with open(input_image_path, "rb") as f:
    image = b64encode(f.read()).decode("utf-8")
```

We will also need the pixel size of the image. For that, we'll load the image into PIL:

```python
from PIL.Image import Image
from base64 import b64encode

input_image_path = "DT4897.jpg"
# Open the image and encode it to base 64.
with open(input_image_path, "rb") as f:
    image = b64encode(f.read()).decode("utf-8")
# Get the image size.
size = Image.open(input_image_path).size
```

Then we'll add and set a textured quad.

- [`create_textured_quad`](../../api/command_api.md#create_textured_quad) creates an *empty* quad (without a texture).
- [`set_texture_quad`](../../api/command_api.md#set_texture_quad) sets the texture of the quad. You can send this more than once for the same quad. Note that we need to send the base 64 string of the image, not the image bytes.

```python
from base64 import b64encode
from PIL import Image
from tdw.controller import Controller
from tdw.tdw_utils import TDWUtils
from tdw.add_ons.third_person_camera import ThirdPersonCamera
from tdw.add_ons.image_capture import ImageCapture
from tdw.backend.paths import EXAMPLE_CONTROLLER_OUTPUT_PATH

"""

input_image_path = "DT4897.jpg"
# Open the image and encode it to base 64.
with open(input_image_path, "rb") as f:
    image = b64encode(f.read()).decode("utf-8")
# Get the image size.
size = Image.open(input_image_path).size
quad_position = {"x": 1, "y": 2, "z": 3}
# Add a camera and enable image capture.
camera = ThirdPersonCamera(avatar_id="a",
                           position={"x": 0, "y": 8, "z": -3},
                           look_at=quad_position)
path = EXAMPLE_CONTROLLER_OUTPUT_PATH.joinpath("textured_quad")
print(f"Images will be saved to: {path}")
capture = ImageCapture(avatar_ids=["a"], path=path)
# Start the controller.
c = Controller()
c.add_ons.extend([camera, capture])
quad_id = c.get_unique_id()
c.communicate([TDWUtils.create_empty_room(8, 8),
               {"$type": "create_textured_quad",
                "position": quad_position,
                "size": {"x": 5, "y": 3},
                "euler_angles": {"x": 0, "y": 30, "z": 0},
                "id": quad_id},
               {"$type": "set_textured_quad",
                "id": quad_id,
                "dimensions": {"x": size[0], "y": size[1]},
                "image": image}])
c.communicate({"$type": "terminate"})
```

Result:

![](images/textured_quad.jpg)

## Command API and output data

In the Unity Engine, textured quads are effectively the same thing as any other non-physics object: They are a game object with a simple mesh (a "quad") and a material, which has an albedo image texture. 

However, in TDW, textured quads are treated very differently than standard [objects](../core_concepts/objects.md). They won't appear in *any* output data except `Images` (and only in the `_img` pass).
