# Fluid

`from tdw.obi_data.fluids.fluid import Fluid`

Data for an Obi fluid. For more information, [read this](http://obi.virtualmethodstudio.com/tutorials/emittermaterials.html).

## Fields

- `smoothing` A rendering parameter that controls the radius of the particle.

- `surface_tension` Increasing this value will make the fluid try to minimize its surface area, causing spherical drops to form.

- `viscosity` Viscosity smooths out the velocity field generated by fluid particles when moving.

- `vorticity` Amount of vorticity confinement, it will contribute to maintain vortical details in the fluid.

- `reflection` Amount of reflection.

- `transparency` Amount of fluid transparency.

- `refraction` Amount of light refraction. This effect is more noticeable in thicker regions of the fluid.

- `buoyancy` Controls the relative density between the fluid and the surrounding air.

- `diffusion` A diffusion value that will modify `diffusion_data`. [Read this for more information.](http://obi.virtualmethodstudio.com/tutorials/particlediffusion.html)

- `diffusion_data` A dictionary of four floats that can be used arbitrarily, for example to colorize a fluid based on its physical state. [Read this for more information.](http://obi.virtualmethodstudio.com/tutorials/particlediffusion.html)

- `atmospheric_drag` The amount of air resistance.

- `atmospheric_pressure` The amount of inward pressure applied by air on the surface of the fluid.

- `particle_z_write` A shader rendering flag. This should be false for semi-transparent objects and true for opaque objects.

- `thickness_cutoff` A threshold for rendering fluid thickness. Regions that are less thick than this are discarded.

- `thickness_downsample` Increase this value to use a lower-resolution rendering buffer.

- `blur_radius` Amount of depth blurring applied before generating normals. Higher values will result in a smoother surface.

- `surface_downsample` Downsampling of the depth/normals buffers. Increase it to use lower-resolution buffers.

- `render_smoothness` Surface smoothness of the fluid. High values will result in small specular glints, lower values will result in a rougher-looking surface.

- `metalness` Controls reflection metalness: high values will cause reflection/specular to be tinted with the fluid's surface color.

- `ambient_multiplier` A parameter that affects the fluid vis a vis the ambient lighting.

- `absorption` How much light is absorbed by the fluid, as light travels trough it: higher values will tint the background with the fluid color.

- `refraction_downsample` Downsampling of the refraction buffers. Increase it to use a lower-resolution buffer.

- `foam_downsample` Downsampling of the foam buffer. Increase it to use a lower-resolution buffer.

- `capacity` The maximum amount of emitted particles.

- `resolution` The size and amount of particles in 1 cubic meter.

- `color` The visual color of the fluid.

- `rest_density` The fluid density in kg/m3.

- `radius_scale` This scales the size at which particles are drawn.

- `random_velocity` Random velocity of emitted particles.
