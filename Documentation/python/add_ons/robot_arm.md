# RobotArm

`from tdw.add_ons.robot_arm import RobotArm`

A robot with a single arm.
This class includes an inverse kinematic (IK) solver that allows the robot to reach for a target position.

## Class Variables

| Variable | Type | Description | Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `NON_MOVING` | float | If a joint has moved less than this many degrees (revolute or spherical) or meters (prismatic) since the previous frame, it is considered to be not moving for the purposes of determining which joints are moving. | `0.001` |

## Functions

#### \_\_init\_\_

**`RobotArm(name)`**

**`RobotArm(name, robot_id=0, position=None, rotation=None, source=None)`**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| name |  str |  | The name of the robot. |
| robot_id |  int  | 0 | The ID of the robot. |
| position |  Dict[str, float] | None | The position of the robot. If None, defaults to `{"x": 0, "y": 0, "z": 0}`. |
| rotation |  Dict[str, float] | None | The rotation of the robot in Euler angles (degrees). If None, defaults to `{"x": 0, "y": 0, "z": 0}`. |
| source |  Union[RobotLibrarian, RobotRecord] | None | The source file of the robot. If None: The source will be the URL of the robot record in TDW's built-in [`RobotLibrarian`](../librarian/robot_librarian.md). If `RobotRecord`: the source is the URL in the record. If `RobotLibrarian`: The source is the record in the provided `RobotLibrarian` that matches `name`. |

#### get_initialization_commands

**`self.get_initialization_commands()`**

This function gets called exactly once per add-on. To re-initialize, set `self.initialized = False`.

_Returns:_  A list of commands that will initialize this add-on.

#### joints_are_moving

**`self.joints_are_moving()`**

**`self.joints_are_moving(joint_ids=None)`**


| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| joint_ids |  List[int] | None | A list of joint IDs to check for movement. If `None`, check all joints for movement. |

_Returns:_  True if the joints are moving.

#### reset

**`self.reset()`**

**`self.reset(position=None, rotation=None)`**

Reset the robot.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| position |  Dict[str, float] | None | The position of the robot. |
| rotation |  Dict[str, float] | None | The rotation of the robot. |

#### on_send

**`self.on_send(resp)`**

This is called after commands are sent to the build and a response is received.

Use this function to send commands to the build on the next frame, given the `resp` response.
Any commands in the `self.commands` list will be sent on the next frame.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| resp |  List[bytes] |  | The response from the build. |

#### before_send

**`self.before_send(commands)`**

This is called before sending commands to the build. By default, this function doesn't do anything.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| commands |  List[dict] |  | The commands that are about to be sent to the build. |

#### set_joint_targets

**`self.set_joint_targets(targets)`**

Set target angles or positions for a dictionary of joints.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| targets |  Dict[int, Union[float, Dict[str, float] |  | A dictionary of joint targets. Key = The ID of the joint. Value = the targets. For spherical joints, this must be a Vector3 dictionary, for example `{"x": 40, "y": 0, "z": 0}` (angles in degrees). For revolute joints, this must be a float (an angle in degrees). For prismatic joints, this must be a float (a distance in meters). |

#### add_joint_forces

**`self.add_joint_forces(forces)`**

Add torques and forces to a dictionary of joints.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| forces |  Dict[int, Union[float, Dict[str, float] |  | A dictionary of joint forces. Key = The ID of the joint. Value = the targets. For spherical joints, this must be a Vector3 dictionary, for example `{"x": 40, "y": 0, "z": 0}` (torques in Newtons). For revolute joints, this must be a float (a torque in Newtons). For prismatic joints, this must be a float (a force in Newtons). |

#### stop_joints

**`self.stop_joints()`**

**`self.stop_joints(joint_ids=None)`**

Stop the joints at their current angles or positions.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| joint_ids |  List[int] | None | A list of joint IDs. If None, stop all joints. |

#### reach_for

**`self.reach_for(target)`**

Start to reach for a target position.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| target |  POSITION |  | The target position. Can be a dictionary or a numpy array. |
