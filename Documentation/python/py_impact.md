## `PyImpact`

`from tdw.py_impact import PyImpact`

Generate impact sounds from physics data.

Sounds are synthesized as described in: [Traer,Cusimano and McDermott, A PERCEPTUALLY INSPIRED GENERATIVE MODEL OF RIGID-BODY CONTACT SOUNDS, Digital Audio Effects, (DAFx), 2019](http://dafx2019.bcu.ac.uk/papers/DAFx2019_paper_57.pdf)

For a general guide on impact sounds in TDW, read [this](../misc_frontend/impact_sounds.md).

For example usage, see: `tdw/Python/example_controllers/impact_sounds.py`
