### Documentation

#### Modified Documentation

| Document             | Description                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `getting_started.md` | 1. The example uses `models_core.json` so it works for everybody.<br>2. Better explanation for how to get object IDs.<br>3. Added image saving to the example. |

## v1.6.1

### New Features

- **Added a working pip module.** It is no longer necessary to download the whole repo to use TDW.
- **The build will automatically launch when you launch a controller.** 
- When you launch a controller, it will automatically check to make sure that your local TDW install it is up-to-date and, if not, offer suggestions for how to upgrade.

For more information, please read [Getting Started](getting_started.md).

### `tdw` module

- `setup.py` now actually works when doing a `pip install`.
- Removed `pymongo` requirement.
- Added `requests` requirement.
- Added `__init__.py` files in `tdw/` and in subdirectories.
- Added new scripts:
    - `tdw/release/build.py` Helper functions for downloading a build from the repo.
    - `tdw/release/pypi.py` Helper functions for version checks vs. PyPi.

#### `Controller`

- Added new constructor parameters:
    - `launch_build` If `True`, the controller will automatically launch a build. If there is no build at the expected location, the controller will download one. Default = `True`
    - `display` If not `None`, and if this is a Linux machine, and if `launch_build == True`, this will launch the build on the matching display.
- If `check_version == True`:
    - The controller will compare the installed `tdw` Python module to the latest PyPi version. If there is a mis-match, it will recommend upgrading; the recommendation it gives will depend on the mismatch (`1.6.0` vs. `1.6.1`; `1.6.1` vs. `1.7.0`, etc.)
    - The controller will compare the version of the downloaded build to the version of the install `tdw` Python module. If they are different versions, it will show the user how to upgrade/downgrade.
- Added: `Controller.launch_build()` Launch the build. If there is no build in the expected location, download one.

#### `tdw.backend.paths`

- Added: `SYSTEM_TO_EXECUTABLE` and `SYSTEM_TO_RELEASE`

### Example Controllers

- `minimal.py` terminates the build after its test.

### Backend

- Added `MANIFEST.in` to `tdw` module.
- Removed `Python/README.md` (this was a copy of the repo's README and is not actually needed for PyPi).
- Removed `tdw.version.last_stable_version` (not needed)

### Documentation

#### New Documentation

| Document | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `build.md` | `Build` class API. |
| `pypi.md` | `PyPi` class API. |

#### Modified Documentation

| Document | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| `getting_started.md` | 1. Added a section for expected coding knowledge.<br>2. Re-wrote instructions for how to install TDW using the pip module.<br>3. Expanded installation instructions for remote servers.<br>4. Explicitly mention when it is required to clone this repo. |
| `releases.md` | Added a section about how version-checking works. |

## v1.6.0

This changelog is only for the _frontend_ of TDW. If you are a backend developer, or are looking for changes prior to v1.6.0, please refer to the changelog in TDWBase.

### New Features

- **Began new `tdw` repo (split from the private dev `TDWBase` repo).**
  - Removed backend scripts and documentation (they are still in `TDWBase`).

#### Removed Commands

| Command                       | Reason                                                       |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `set_day_night`               | This command enabled/disabled all lights in the scene; HDRI skyboxes can be used for *far* better results. |
| `set_material_from_resources` | Only usable in forked versions of TDWBase with extra materials in Resources/. Functionality can be replicated with local material asset bundles. |
| `set_semantic_material`       | Always sets the material as `"undefined"` (because visual materials are, as yet, unclassified). Note: `set_semantic_material_to` is still in the Command API. |
| `update_flex_container`       | Deprecated in v1.5                                           |
| `set_gravity` | Doesn't work as advertised (it makes objects kinematic too).<br>Functionality overlaps with `set_kinematic_state`, `simulate_physics`, and `set_gravity_vector`. |
| `set_shadows` | Functionality can be replicated via: `{"$type": "set_render_quality", "render_quality": 0}`<br>Note: `set_shadow_strength`, a different command, hasn't been removed. |

### Asset Bundle Libraries

- **Updated asset bundle URLs for every asset bundle.** The URLs now point towards binaries stored in the `tdw-public` and `tdw-private` S3 buckets.

#### Models

##### `models_full.json`

- **All models in `models_full.json` that are not also in `models_core.json` ("non-free models") now require S3 access keys in order to download.**

### Python

- Set default `--library` value in `multi_env.py` to `models_full.json` (was `models_core.json`)
- Slight efficiency improvements in `single_object.py`

### Docker

- Updated Docker file, bash scripts, controller, and documentation for v1.6
- Docker file always downloads the latest TDW release.
