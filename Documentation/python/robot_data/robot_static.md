# RobotStatic

`from tdw.robot_data.robot_static import RobotStatic`

Static data for a robot that won't change due to physics (such as the joint IDs, segmentation colors, etc.)

***

## Fields

- `robot_id` The ID of the robot.

- `joints` A dictionary of [Static robot joint data](joint_static.md) for each joint. Key = The ID of the joint.

- `joint_ids_by_name` A dictionary of joint names. Key = The name of the joint. Value = The joint ID.

- `non_moving` A dictionary of [Static data for non-moving parts](non_moving.md) for each non-moving part. Key = The ID of the part.

- `body_parts` A list of joint IDs and non-moving body part IDs.

- `immovable` If True, the robot is immovable.

- `robot_index` The index of the robot in `DynamicRobots` output data. This is used internally; you almost always want to refer to `self.robot_id` instead.
