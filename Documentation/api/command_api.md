| [`apply_force`](#apply_force) | Apply a force into the world to an target position. The force will impact any objects between the origin and the target position. |
| [`create_avatar`](#create_avatar) | Create an avatar (agent). |
| [`create_empty_environment`](#create_empty_environment) | Create an empty environment. This must be called after load_scene.  |
| [`create_vr_rig`](#create_vr_rig) | Create an Oculus VR rig. For more information, see: Documentation/misc_frontend/vr.md |
| [`destroy_all_objects`](#destroy_all_objects) | Destroy all objects and avatars in the scene.  |
| [`do_nothing`](#do_nothing) | Do nothing. Useful for benchmarking.  |
| [`enable_reflection_probes`](#enable_reflection_probes) | Enable or disable the reflection probes in the scene. By default, the reflection probes are enabled. Disabling the reflection probes will yield less realistic images but will improve the speed of the simulation. |
| [`load_scene`](#load_scene) | Loads a new locally-stored scene. Unloads an existing scene (if any). This command must be sent before create_exterior_walls or create_empty_environment This command does not need to be sent along with an add_scene command. |
| [`pause_editor`](#pause_editor) | Pause Unity Editor.  |
| [`perlin_noise_terrain`](#perlin_noise_terrain) | Initialize a scene environment with procedurally generated "terrain" using Perlin noise. This command will return Meshes output data which will contain the mesh data of the terrain.  |
| [`send_nav_mesh_path`](#send_nav_mesh_path) | Tell the build to send data of a path on the NavMesh from the origin to the destination.  |
| [`set_ambient_intensity`](#set_ambient_intensity) | Set how much the ambient light fom the source affects the scene. Low values will darken the scene overall, to simulate evening /night light levels. |
| [`set_download_timeout`](#set_download_timeout) | Set the timeout after which an Asset Bundle Command (e.g. add_object) will retry a download. The default timeout is 30 minutes, which should always be sufficient. Send this command only if your computer or Internet connection is very slow. |
| [`set_error_handling`](#set_error_handling) | Set whether TDW will quit when it logs different types of messages.  |
| [`set_floorplan_roof`](#set_floorplan_roof) | Show or hide the roof of a floorplan scene. This command only works if the current scene is a floorplan added via the add_scene command: "floorplan_1a", "floorplan_4b", etc.  |
| [`set_gravity_vector`](#set_gravity_vector) | Set the gravity vector in the scene. |
| [`set_physics_solver_iterations`](#set_physics_solver_iterations) | Set the number of physics solver iterations, which affects the overall accuracy of the physics engine. |
| [`set_render_quality`](#set_render_quality) | Set the render quality level. The highest render quality level enables near-photorealism runtime rendering. The lowest render quality has "flat" rendering, no shadows, etc. The lower the render quality, the faster the simulation will run, especially in scenes with complex lighting. |
| [`set_screen_size`](#set_screen_size) | Set the screen size. Any images the build creates will also be this size. |
| [`set_shadow_strength`](#set_shadow_strength) | Set the shadow strength of all lights in the scene. This only works if you already sent load_scene or add_scene. |
| [`set_sleep_threshold`](#set_sleep_threshold) | Set the global Rigidbody "sleep threshold", the mass-normalized energy threshold below which objects start going to sleep. A "sleeping" object is completely still until moved again by a force (object impact, force command, etc.) |
| [`set_socket_timeout`](#set_socket_timeout) | DEPRECATED: This command doesn't actually do anything! Set the timeout duration for the socket used to communicate with the controller. Occasionally, the build's socket will stop receiving messages from the controller. This is an inevitable consequence of how synchronous receive-response sockets work. When this happens, it will wait until the socket times out, close the socket, and alert the controller that it needs to re-send its message. The timeout duration shouldn't be less than the time required to send/receive commands, or the build will never receive anything! You should only send this command if it takes longer than the default timeout to send/receive commands.  |
| [`set_target_framerate`](#set_target_framerate) | Set the target render framerate of the build. For more information: <ulink url="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Application-targetFrameRate.html">https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Application-targetFrameRate.html</ulink> |

| [`step_physics`](#step_physics) | Step through the physics without triggering new avatar output, or new commands. |
| [`terminate`](#terminate) | Terminate the build.  |
| [`unload_asset_bundles`](#unload_asset_bundles) | Unloads all AssetBundles. Send this command only after destroying all objects in the scene. This command should be used only to free up memory. After sending it, you will need to re-download any objects you want to add to a scene.  |
| [`unload_unused_assets`](#unload_unused_assets) | Unload lingering assets (scenes, models, textures, etc.) from memory. Send this command if you're rapidly adding and removing objects or scenes in order to prevent apparent memory leaks. |

| [`use_pre_signed_urls`](#use_pre_signed_urls) | Toggle whether to download asset bundles (models, scenes, etc.) directly from byte streams of S3 objects, or from temporary URLs that expire after ten minutes. Only send this command and set this to True if you're experiencing segfaults when downloading models from models_full.json Initial value = On Ubuntu 20: True (use temporary URLs); on all other platforms, False (download S3 objects directly, without using temporary URLs). |

| --- | --- |
| [`add_constant_force`](#add_constant_force) | Add a constant force to an object. Every frame, this force will be applied to the Rigidbody.

| [`apply_force_at_position`](#apply_force_at_position) | Apply a force to an object from a position.

***

## **`set_socket_timeout`**

DEPRECATED: This command doesn't actually do anything! Set the timeout duration for the socket used to communicate with the controller. Occasionally, the build's socket will stop receiving messages from the controller. This is an inevitable consequence of how synchronous receive-response sockets work. When this happens, it will wait until the socket times out, close the socket, and alert the controller that it needs to re-send its message. The timeout duration shouldn't be less than the time required to send/receive commands, or the build will never receive anything! You should only send this command if it takes longer than the default timeout to send/receive commands. 

- <font style="color:orange">**Deprecated**: This command has been deprecated. In the next major TDW update (1.x.0), this command will be removed.</font>

```python
