# C# Source Code for TDW

The public release of TDW contains all Python code, full documentation and binary executable "builds" of the simulation engine for Linux, OSX and Windows.  The C# source code is in a closed-source private repo because it contains non-free third-party code purchased by the TDW development team. While it would technically be possible to release the free portion of the C# source code, doing so would involve many technical challenges and legal implications, none of which we've addressed yet. Resolving this issue is a high priority for the TDW development team.
