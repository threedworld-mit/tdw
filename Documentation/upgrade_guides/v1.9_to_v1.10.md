# How to upgrade from TDW v1.9 to v1.10

## Read the changelog

[Read this](../Changelog.md) for a complete list of changes. Most of the changes in TDW v1.10 are relatively minor but may require you to adjust the code in your controllers.

## 1. Object data is faster and array-like return values are numpy arrays

Object data such as `Transforms`, `Rigidbodies`, and `Bounds` is significantly faster in TDW v1.10. There are some small API changes associated with this improvement that affect array-like return values (e.g. `transforms.get_rotation()` or `rigidbodies.get_velocity()`) for the following output data types:

- `Transforms`
- `Rigidbodies`
- `StaticRigidbodies`
- `Bounds`
- `SegmentationColors` 
- `LocalTransforms`
- `DynamicCompositeObjects`

Previously, per-object return values, such as the position of the object, were returned as a tuple. Now, they are all returned as numpy arrays.

If you are using `ObjectManager` or `CompositeObjectManager` to handle object data, the API and return values are exactly the same as before.

Consider this minimal example, which prints the position of the object:

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller
from tdw.tdw_utils import TDWUtils
from tdw.output_data import OutputData, Transforms

c = Controller()
resp = c.communicate([TDWUtils.create_empty_room(12, 12),
                      Controller.get_add_object(model_name="rh10",
                                                object_id=0),
                      {"$type": "send_transforms",
                       "frequency": "once"}])
for i in range(len(resp) - 1):
    r_id = OutputData.get_data_type_id(resp[i])
    if r_id == "tran":
        transform = Transforms(resp[i])
        position = transform.get_position(0)
        print(position)
c.communicate({"$type": "terminate"})
```

Output:

| TDW v1.9                                                     | TDW v1.10                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `(-1.4852732419967651e-05, 0.001660674810409546, 2.7572386898100376e-06)` | `[-1.4852732e-05  1.6606748e-03  2.7572387e-06]` |

If your controller unpacked the values of the tuple, be aware that this is no longer allowed:

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller
from tdw.tdw_utils import TDWUtils
from tdw.output_data import OutputData, Transforms

c = Controller()
resp = c.communicate([TDWUtils.create_empty_room(12, 12),
                      Controller.get_add_object(model_name="rh10",
                                                object_id=0),
                      {"$type": "send_transforms",
                       "frequency": "once"}])
for i in range(len(resp) - 1):
    r_id = OutputData.get_data_type_id(resp[i])
    if r_id == "tran":
        transform = Transforms(resp[i])
        x, y, z = transform.get_position(0)  # This will not work in TDW v1.10
c.communicate({"$type": "terminate"})
```

## 2. Restructured composite object output data

The command `send_composite_objects` and the output data `CompositeObjects` have been removed. Use `send_static_composite_objects` (returns `StaticCompositeObjects`) and `send_dynamic_composite_objects` (returns `DynamicCompositeObjects`) instead. You can also use the `CompositeObjectManager` wrapper add-on.

`DynamicCompositeObjects` was added in TDW v1.9 and has been restructured in v1.10 in order to be faster. The changes mostly affect the underlying data classes and will probably be invisible to most users.

## 3. Replaced ProcGenRoom floor commands

ProcGenFloor commands have been replaced with commands  that will work in other scenes as well:

| v1.9                               | v1.10                     |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `set_proc_gen_floor_color`         | `set_floor_color`         |
| `set_proc_gen_floor_texture_scale` | `set_floor_texture_scale` |
| `set_proc_gen_floor_material`      | `set_floor_material`      |

## 4. Removed the Sticky Mitten Avatars

The Sticky Mitten Avatars were deprecated in TDW v1.8 in favor of Magnebot; they have been removed as of TDW v1.10. [Read this for how to switch to Magnebot.](v1.7_to_v1.8.md)

## 5. Removed avatar `A_Img_Caps`

Use `A_Simple_Body` instead with a capsule body or the add-on wrapper class [`EmbodiedAvatar`](../python/add_ons/embodied_avatar.md).

## 6. Renamed `PhysicsAudioRecorder` fields

`PhysicsAudioRecorder.recording` is now `PhysicsAudioRecorder.done`. Additionally, there is a new `record_audio` constructor parameter (defaults to `True`).
