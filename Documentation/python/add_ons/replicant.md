# Replicant

`from tdw.add_ons.replicant import Replicant`

A Replicant is a human-like agent that can interact with the scene with pseudo-physics behavior.

When a Replicant collides with objects, it initiates a physics-driven collision. The Replicant's own movements are driven by non-physics animation.

A Replicant can walk, turn, reach for positions or objects, grasp and drop objects, and turn its head to look around.

## Functions

#### \_\_init\_\_

**`Replicant(position, rotation)`**

**`Replicant(replicant_id=0, position, rotation, image_frequency=ImageFrequency.once, name="replicant_0", target_framerate=100)`**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| replicant_id |  int  | 0 | The ID of the Replicant. |
| position |  Union[Dict[str, float] |  | The position of the Replicant as an x, y, z dictionary or numpy array. If None, defaults to `{"x": 0, "y": 0, "z": 0}`. |
| rotation |  Union[Dict[str, float] |  | The rotation of the Replicant in Euler angles (degrees) as an x, y, z dictionary or numpy array. If None, defaults to `{"x": 0, "y": 0, "z": 0}`. |

***

### Movement

These actions move or turn the Replicant.

#### turn_by

**`self.turn_by(angle)`**

Turn the Replicant by an angle.

This is a non-animated action, meaning that the Replicant will immediately snap to the angle.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| angle |  float |  | The target angle in degrees. Positive value = clockwise turn. |

#### turn_to

**`self.turn_to(target)`**

Turn the Replicant to face a target object or position.

This is a non-animated action, meaning that the Replicant will immediately snap to the angle.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| target |  Union[int, Dict[str, float] |  | The target. If int: An object ID. If dict: A position as an x, y, z dictionary. If numpy array: A position as an [x, y, z] numpy array. |

#### move_by

**`self.move_by(distance)`**

**`self.move_by(distance, reset_arms=True, reset_arms_duration=0.25, scale_reset_arms_duration=True, arrived_at=0.1, max_walk_cycles=100)`**

Walk a given distance.

The Replicant will continuously play a walk cycle animation until the action ends.

The action can end for several reasons depending on the collision detection rules (see [`self.collision_detection`](../replicant/collision_detection.md).

- If the Replicant walks the target distance, the action succeeds.
- If `collision_detection.previous_was_same == True`, and the previous action was `move_by()` or `move_to()`, and it was in the same direction (forwards/backwards), and the previous action ended in failure, this action ends immediately.
- If `self.collision_detection.avoid_obstacles == True` and the Replicant encounters a wall or object in its path:
- If the object is in `self.collision_detection.exclude_objects`, the Replicant ignores it.
- Otherwise, the action ends in failure.
- If the Replicant collides with an object or a wall and `self.collision_detection.objects == True` and/or `self.collision_detection.walls == True` respectively:
- If the object is in `self.collision_detection.exclude_objects`, the Replicant ignores it.
- Otherwise, the action ends in failure.
- If the Replicant takes too long to reach the target distance, the action ends in failure (see `self.max_walk_cycles`).

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| distance |  float |  | The target distance. If less than 0, the Replicant will walk backwards. |
| reset_arms |  bool  | True | If True, reset the arms to their neutral positions while beginning the walk cycle. |
| reset_arms_duration |  float  | 0.25 | The speed at which the arms are reset in seconds. |
| scale_reset_arms_duration |  bool  | True | If True, `reset_arms_duration` will be multiplied by `framerate / 60)`, ensuring smoother motions at faster-than-life simulation speeds. |
| arrived_at |  float  | 0.1 | If at any point during the action the difference between the target distance and distance traversed is less than this, then the action is successful. |
| max_walk_cycles |  int  | 100 | The walk animation will loop this many times maximum. If by that point the Replicant hasn't reached its destination, the action fails. |

#### move_to

**`self.move_to(target)`**

**`self.move_to(target, reset_arms=True, reset_arms_duration=0.25, scale_reset_arms_duration=True, arrived_at=0.1, max_walk_cycles=100, bounds_position="center")`**

Turn the Replicant to a target position or object and then walk to it.

While walking, the Replicant will continuously play a walk cycle animation until the action ends.

The action can end for several reasons depending on the collision detection rules (see [`self.collision_detection`](../replicant/collision_detection.md).

- If the Replicant walks the target distance, the action succeeds.
- If `collision_detection.previous_was_same == True`, and the previous action was `move_by()` or `move_to()`, and it was in the same direction (forwards/backwards), and the previous action ended in failure, this action ends immediately.
- If `self.collision_detection.avoid_obstacles == True` and the Replicant encounters a wall or object in its path:
- If the object is in `self.collision_detection.exclude_objects`, the Replicant ignores it.
- Otherwise, the action ends in failure.
- If the Replicant collides with an object or a wall and `self.collision_detection.objects == True` and/or `self.collision_detection.walls == True` respectively:
- If the object is in `self.collision_detection.exclude_objects`, the Replicant ignores it.
- Otherwise, the action ends in failure.
- If the Replicant takes too long to reach the target distance, the action ends in failure (see `self.max_walk_cycles`).

### Arm Articulation

These actions move and bend the joints of the Replicant's arms.

**`self.reach_for(target, arm, absolute=True, offhand_follows=False, arrived_at=0.09, max_distance=1.5, duration=0.25, scale_duration=True, rotations)`**

Reach for a target object or position. One or both hands can reach for the target at the same time.

If target is an object, the target position is a point on the object.
If the object has affordance points, the target position is the affordance point closest to the hand.
Otherwise, the target position is the bounds position closest to the hand.

The Replicant's arm(s) will continuously move over multiple `communicate()` calls move until either the motion is complete or the arm collides with something (see `self.collision_detection`).

- If the hand is near the target at the end of the action, the action succeeds.
- If the target is too far away at the start of the action, the action fails.
- The collision detection will respond normally to walls, objects, obstacle avoidance, etc.
- If `self.collision_detection.previous_was_same == True`, and if the previous action was a subclass of `ArmMotion`, and it ended in a collision, this action ends immediately.

| absolute |  bool  | True | If True, the target position is in world space coordinates. If False, the target position is relative to the Replicant. Ignored if `target` is an int. |
| offhand_follows |  bool  | False | If True, the offhand will follow the primary hand, meaning that it will maintain the same relative position. Ignored if `arm` is a list or `target` is an int. |

| max_distance |  float  | 1.5 | The maximum distance from the hand to the target position. |
| duration |  float  | 0.25 | The duration of the motion in seconds. |
| scale_duration |  bool  | True | If True, `duration` will be multiplied by `framerate / 60)`, ensuring smoother motions at faster-than-life simulation speeds. |
