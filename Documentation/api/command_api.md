| `"generate_random_seed"` | bool | If True, the random seed will be explicitly set. | True |
| `"random_seed"` | int | The random seed. Ignored if generate_random_seed == False. | 0 |

| `"min_collision_speed"` | float | The minimum collision speed in meters per second. If a <computeroutput>CollisionEvent</computeroutput> has a speed less than this, it is ignored. | 0.00001 |
| `"area_new_collision"` | float | On a collision stay event, if the previous area is None and the current area is greater than this, the audio event is either an impact or a scrape; see scrape_angle. | 1e-5 |
| `"scrape_angle"` | float | On a collision stay event, there is a large new contact area (see area_new_collision), if the angle in degrees between Vector3.up and the normalized relative velocity of the collision is greater than this value, then the audio event is a scrape. Otherwise, it's an impact. | 80 |
| `"impact_area_ratio"` | float | On a collision stay event, if the area of the collision increases by at least this factor, the audio event is an impact. | 5 |
| `"roll_angular_speed"` | float | On a collision stay event, if the angular speed in meters per second is greater than or equal to this value, the audio event is a roll; otherwise, it's a scrape. | 1 |
| `"max_contact_separation"` | float | On a collision stay event, if we think the collision is an impact but any of the contact points are this far away or greater, the audio event is none. | 1e-8 |
| `"filter_duplicates"` | bool | Each object in Clatter tries to filter duplicate collision events in two ways. First, it will remove any reciprocal pairs of objects, i.e. it will accept a collision between objects 0 and 1 but not objects 1 and 0. Second, it will register only the first collision between objects per main-thread update (multiple collisions can be registered because there are many physics fixed update calls in between). To allow duplicate events, set this field to False. | True |
| `"max_num_contacts"` | int | The maximum number of contact points that will be evaluated when setting the contact area and speed. A higher number can mean somewhat greater precision but at the cost of performance. | 16 |

| `"prevent_impact_distortion"` | bool | If True, clamp impact audio amplitude values to less than or equal to 0.99, preventing distortion. | True |
| `"clamp_impact_contact_time"` | bool | If True, clamp impact contact time values to a plausible value. Set this to False if you want to generate impacts with unusually long contact times. | True |
| `"min_time_between_impacts"` | float | The minimum time in seconds between impacts. If an impact occurs an this much time hasn't yet elapsed, the impact will be ignored. This can prevent strange "droning" sounds caused by too many impacts in rapid succession. | 0.25 |
| `"max_time_between_impacts"` | float | The maximum time in seconds between impacts. After this many seconds, this impact series will end and a subsequent impact collision will start a new Impact. | 3 |
| `"scrape_amp"` | float | When setting the amplitude for a scrape, multiply simulation_amp by this factor. | 1 |
| `"roughness_ratio_exponent"` | float | An exponent for each scrape material's roughness ratio. A lower value will cause all scrape audio to be louder relative to impact audio. | 0.7 |
| `"max_scrape_speed"` | float | For the purposes of scrape audio generation, the collision speed is clamped to this maximum value. | 5 |
| `"loop_scrape_audio"` | bool | If True, fill in silences while scrape audio is being generated by continuously looping the current chunk of scrape audio until either there is new scrape audio or the scrape event ends. | True |
| `"environment_impact_material"` | ImpactMaterialUnsized | The impact material for the environment (floors, walls, etc.). | "wood_medium" |
| `"environment_size"` | int | The impact material size bucket for the environment (floors, walls, etc.). | 4 |

| `"environment_resonance"` | float | The resonance value for the environment (floors, walls, etc.). | 0.1 |
| `"environment_mass"` | float | For the purposes of audio generation, this is the mass of the environment (floors, walls, etc.). | 100 |
| `"resonance_audio"` | bool | If True, use Resonance Audio to play audio. | False |
| `"max_num_events"` | int | The maximum number of impacts, scrapes, and rolls that can be processed on a single communicate() call. | 200 |
| `"roll_substitute"` | AudioEventType | Roll audio events are not yet supported in Clatter. If a roll is registered, it is instead treated as this value. | "impact" |

It also handles angular motion much better. However, in some cases, high speed objects may still tunneling through other geometries. |
| `"discrete"` | (From Unity documentation: This is the fastest mode.) |
| `"continuous"` | (From Unity documentation: Collisions will be detected for any static mesh geometry in the path of this Rigidbody, even if the collision occurs between two FixedUpdate steps. Static mesh geometry is any MeshCollider which does not have a Rigidbody attached. This also prevent Rigidbodies set to ContinuousDynamic mode from passing through this Rigidbody. |

# SetFlexActor

These commands create a new FlexActor of type T with a FlexAsset of type U, or to modify an object that already has a component of type T. This command must be sent before applying any other Flex commands to an object. You probably will want to send set_kinematic_state prior to sending this command.
