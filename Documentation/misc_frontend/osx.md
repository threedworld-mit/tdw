# TDW and OS X

There are a few common problems users experience when running TDW on OS X. Here are the known solutions:

## "I can't run the .app"

There are two ways to run the .app of the build, each of which has a different solution:

### Running the .app in the shell

You might want to run the .app in the shell to utilize [command-line arguments](../getting_started.md). 

As with all OS X programs, the .app can't be directly opened in the shell. Instead:

1. Click right on the .app file
2. Click on Show Package Contents 
3. Find the executable in the MacOS folder (e.g.  “TDW_v1.5.0”) and drag that to your bash shell window.

### Double-clicking the .app

If you aren't using command-line arguments, you can double-click and run the .app like any other.

## "When I double-click TDW.app I get an error: `TDW.app is damaged and can't be opened`"

This is a [known Unity bug](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/macos-builds-now-contain-a-quarantine-attribute) and it will occur if you download the build from TDW's releases page. To fix it, run `setup.sh` (located in the same directory as `TDW.app`).

## "I'm receiving `localhost` errors"

The build might fail to do anything because `localhost` isn't a listed host. In Unity Editor, you'll see an error like this:

```

## "I can't use NVIDIA Flex"

[Flex](flex.md) doesn't work on OS X.

## "The build crashes when I'm trying to use Resonance Audio"

There is a [known bug](https://github.com/threedworld-mit/tdw/issues/200) in Resonance Audio that causes it to log harmless exceptions. By default, TDW will quit if it logs an exception.

If you see `DllNotFoundException: audiopluginresonanceaudio` in the player log, you need to send the `set_error_handling` command to tell TDW to ignore exceptions before sending any Resonance Audio commands (`set_reverb_space_simple`, `set_reverb_space_expert`, `add_environ_audio_sensor`). You only need to send `set_error_handling` once.

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller

c = Controller()
c.communicate([{"$type": "set_error_handling",
                "exception": False},
               {"$type": "add_environ_audio_sensor"}])
```

See `tdw/Python/example_controllers/audio.py` for a complete example.
