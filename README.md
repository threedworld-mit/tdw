# ThreeDWorld (TDW)

**ThreeDWorld (TDW)** is a platform for interactive multi-modal physical simulation. With TDW, users can simulate high-fidelity sensory data and physical interactions between mobile agents and objects in a wide variety of rich 3D environments. 

This repo contains most of TDW's Python code, including the `tdw` Python module.
