# MoveTo

`from tdw.replicant.actions.move_to import MoveTo`

Turn the Replicant to a target position or object and then walk to it.

While walking, the Replicant will continuously play a walk cycle animation until the action ends.

The action can end for several reasons depending on the collision detection rules (see [`self.collision_detection`](../collision_detection.md).

- If the Replicant walks the target distance (i.e. it reaches its target), the action succeeds.
- If `self.collision_detection.previous_was_same == True`, and the previous action was `MoveBy` or `MoveTo`, and it was in the same direction (forwards/backwards), and the previous action ended in failure, this action ends immediately.
- If `self.collision_detection.avoid_obstacles == True` and the Replicant encounters a wall or object in its path:
  - If the object is in `self.collision_detection.exclude_objects`, the Replicant ignores it.
  - Otherwise, the action ends in failure.
- If the Replicant collides with an object or a wall and `self.collision_detection.objects == True` and/or `self.collision_detection.walls == True` respectively:
  - If the object is in `self.collision_detection.exclude_objects`, the Replicant ignores it.
  - Otherwise, the action ends in failure.

## Fields

- `target` The target. If int: An object ID. If dict: A position as an x, y, z dictionary. If numpy array: A position as an [x, y, z] numpy array.

- `collision_detection` The [`CollisionDetection`](../collision_detection.md) rules.

- `reset_arms` If True, reset the arms to their neutral positions while beginning the walk cycle.

- `reset_arms_duration` The speed at which the arms are reset in seconds.

- `scale_reset_arms_duration` If True, `reset_arms_duration` will be multiplied by `framerate / 60)`, ensuring smoother motions at faster-than-life simulation speeds.

- `arrived_at` If at any point during the action the difference between the target distance and distance traversed is less than this, then the action is successful.

- `bounds_position` If `target` is an integer object ID, move towards this bounds point of the object. Options: `"center"`, `"top`", `"bottom"`, `"left"`, `"right"`, `"front"`, `"back"`.

- `animation` The name of the walk animation.

- `library` The name of the walk animation's library.

- `collision_avoidance_distance` If `collision_detection.avoid == True`, an overlap will be cast at this distance from the Wheelchair Replicant to detect obstacles.

- `collision_avoidance_half_extents` If `collision_detection.avoid == True`, an overlap will be cast with these half extents to detect obstacles.

- `status` [The current status of the action.](../action_status.md) By default, this is `ongoing` (the action isn't done).

- `initialized` If True, the action has initialized. If False, the action will try to send `get_initialization_commands(resp)` on this frame.

- `done` If True, this action is done and won't send any more commands.
