# ObjectStatic

`from tdw.object_data.object_static import ObjectStatic`

Static data for an object. This data won't change between frames.

***

## Fields

- `object_id` The unique ID of the object.

- `name` [The name of the model.](https://github.com/threedworld-mit/tdw/blob/master/Documentation/python/librarian/model_librarian.md)

- `category` The semantic category of the object.

- `kinematic` If True, this object is kinematic, and won't respond to physics.

- `segmentation_color` The RGB segmentation color for the object as a numpy array: `[r, g, b]`

- `mass` The mass of the object.

- `size` The size of the object as a numpy array: `[width, height, length]`

- `dynamic_friction` The dynamic friction of the object.

- `static_friction` The static friction of the object.

- `bounciness` The bounciness of the object.
