# How to upgrade from TDW v1.8 to v1.9

## Read the changelog

[Read this](../Changelog.md) for a complete list of changes. TDW v1.9 introduces *many* changes; this document only covers cases in which you might need to adjust existing code.

## 1. Complete re-write of the documentation

All non-API documentation has been completely rewritten. Documentation is now divided into "lessons" for specified subjects such as robotics or visual perception. You can find the complete table of contents on the README. **Even if you are an experienced TDW user, we recommend you read our new documentation.** You might learn new techniques!

***

## 2. Added: Add-ons

[Add-ons](../lessons/core_concepts/add_ons.md) are a new feature to TDW that will automatically inject commands into every `communicate([])` call. They are very useful for commonplace tasks such as image capture as well as managing agent code.

Add-ons don't *replace* any existing functionality in TDW; they merely *reorganize* it. We recommend upgrading your code to use add-ons, but add-ons are never a *necessary* aspect of TDW.

***

## 3. Changes to `Controller`

### A. Removed `Controller.start()`

This function used to send a command to initialize a scene in TDW. Now, that command is sent automatically in the Controller constructor.

In v1.8:

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller
from tdw.tdw_utils import TDWUtils

c = Controller()
c.start()
c.communicate(TDWUtils.create_empty_room(12, 12))
```

In v1.9:

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller
from tdw.tdw_utils import TDWUtils

c = Controller()
c.communicate(TDWUtils.create_empty_room(12, 12))
```

### B. Removed `Controller.load_streamed_scene(scene)`

This function hasn't been the preferred way to load a stream scene for a while now because it doesn't let you send additional commands on the same frame. We recommend using `Controller.get_add_scene(scene_name)` instead.

In v1.8:

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller

c = Controller()
c.load_streamed_scene(scene="tdw_room")
```

In v1.9:

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller

c = Controller()
c.communicate(c.get_add_scene(scene_name="tdw_room"))
```

### C. Removed `Controller.add_object(model_name)`

This function hasn't been the preferred way to add an object for a while now because it doesn't let you send additional commands on the same frame. We recommend using `Controller.get_add_object(model_name)` instead.

In v1.8:

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller
from tdw.tdw_utils import TDWUtils

c = Controller()
c.start()
c.communicate(TDWUtils.create_empty_room(12, 12))
object_id = c.add_object(model_name="iron_box")
```

In v1.9:

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller
from tdw.tdw_utils import TDWUtils

c = Controller()
c.communicate([TDWUtils.create_empty_room(12, 12),
               c.get_add_object(model_name="iron_box",
                                object_id=c.get_unique_id())])
```

### D. Removed all librarian fields and replaced them with class variables

This allows cached librarians to be accessible outside of the controller.

`self.model_librarian` has been replaced with `Controller.MODEL_LIBRARIANS`, a dictionary that is automatically populated as libraries are added. Likewise, `self.scene_librarian` has been replaced with `Controller.SCENE_LIBRARIANS` and so on.

In v1.8:

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller
from tdw.tdw_utils import TDWUtils

c = Controller()
c.start()
c.communicate([TDWUtils.create_empty_room(12, 12),
               c.get_add_object(model_name="iron_box",
                                library="models_core.json",
                                object_id=c.get_unique_id())])
print(c.model_librarian.library) # Path to models_core.json
```

In v1.9:

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller
from tdw.tdw_utils import TDWUtils

c = Controller()
print(Controller.MODEL_LIBRARIANS.keys()) # dict_keys([])
c.communicate([TDWUtils.create_empty_room(12, 12),
               c.get_add_object(model_name="iron_box",
                                library="models_core.json",
                                object_id=c.get_unique_id())])
print(Controller.MODEL_LIBRARIANS.keys()) # dict_keys(['models_core.json'])
```

### E. Removed `check_build_process` in the `Controller` constructor

This was introduced in v1.8 and ended up not being that useful; it also slows down the controller too much to be practical.

***

## 4. Refactored `PyImpact`

[`PyImpact` is now an add-on](../lessons/py_impact/py_impact.md) and now has scrape sounds. The code for generating audio sounds is mostly the same but the code for adding PyImpact to a controller is very different, and a lot easier to use.

This is the code to required to generate impact audio in v1.8:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from tdw.controller import Controller
from tdw.py_impact import PyImpact, AudioMaterial
from tdw.tdw_utils import TDWUtils, AudioUtils
from tdw.object_init_data import AudioInitData
from tdw.output_data import OutputData, Rigidbodies, AudioSources

c = Controller()
c.start()
commands = [{"$type": "load_scene",
             "scene_name": "ProcGenScene"},
            TDWUtils.create_empty_room(12, 12)]
a = AudioInitData(name="vase_02",
                  position={"x": 0, "y": 2, "z": 0})
object_id, object_commands = a.get_commands()
commands.extend(object_commands)
avatar_id = "a"
commands.extend(TDWUtils.create_avatar(position={"x": 0, "y": 2, "z": 2},
                                       look_at={"x": 0, "y": 0, "z": 0},
                                       avatar_id=avatar_id))
commands.extend([{"$type": "add_audio_sensor",
                  "avatar_id": avatar_id},
                 {"$type": "send_rigidbodies",
                  "frequency": "always"},
                 {"$type": "send_collisions",
                  "enter": True,
                  "stay": True,
                  "exit": True,
                  "collision_types": ["obj", "env"]},
                 {"$type": "send_audio_sources",
                  "frequency": "always"}])
resp = c.communicate(commands)
py_impact = PyImpact()
py_impact.set_default_audio_info(object_names={object_id: "vase_02"})
output_directory = Path.home().joinpath("tdw_example_controller_output/py_impact")
if not output_directory.exists():
    output_directory.mkdir(parents=True)
AudioUtils.start(output_path=output_directory.joinpath("audio.wav"))
num_frames = 0
done = False
while not done and num_frames < 1000:
    for i in range(len(resp) - 1):
        r_id = OutputData.get_data_type_id(resp[i])
        if r_id == "rigi":
            rigi = Rigidbodies(resp[i])
            for j in range(rigi.get_num()):
                if rigi.get_id(j) == object_id:
                    if rigi.get_sleeping(j):
                        done = True
                        break
    commands = py_impact.get_audio_commands(resp=resp,
                                            floor=AudioMaterial.wood_medium,
                                            wall=AudioMaterial.wood_medium)
    resp = c.communicate(commands)
audio_playing = True
while audio_playing:
    for i in range(len(resp) - 1):
        r_id = OutputData.get_data_type_id(resp[i])
        if r_id == "audi":
            audi = AudioSources(resp[i])
            for j in range(audi.get_num()):
                if audi.get_object_id(j) == object_id:
                    if not audi.get_is_playing(j):
                        audio_playing = False
                        break
    resp = c.communicate([])
AudioUtils.stop()
c.communicate({"$type": "terminate"})
```

This will record the exact same scenario in v1.9:

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller
from tdw.tdw_utils import TDWUtils
from tdw.add_ons.py_impact import PyImpact
from tdw.add_ons.audio_initializer import AudioInitializer
from tdw.add_ons.physics_audio_recorder import PhysicsAudioRecorder
from tdw.backend.paths import EXAMPLE_CONTROLLER_OUTPUT_PATH

c = Controller()
py_impact = PyImpact()
audio = AudioInitializer(avatar_id="a")
recorder = PhysicsAudioRecorder(max_frames=1000)
c.add_ons.extend([audio, py_impact, recorder])
commands = [TDWUtils.create_empty_room(12, 12)]
commands.extend(TDWUtils.create_avatar(position={"x": 0, "y": 2, "z": 2},
                                       look_at={"x": 0, "y": 0, "z": 0},
                                       avatar_id="a"))
commands.extend(c.get_add_physics_object(model_name="vase_02",
                                         object_id=0,
                                         position={"x": 0, "y": 2, "z": 0}))
recorder.start(path=EXAMPLE_CONTROLLER_OUTPUT_PATH.joinpath("py_impact/audio.wav"))
c.communicate(commands)
while recorder.recording:
    c.communicate([])
c.communicate({"$type": "terminate"})
```

## 5. Other changes to the `tdw` module

### A. Replaced `FloorplanController` with `Floorplan` add-on

The `Floorplan` add-on is much more versatile; it can be appended to any controller.

`FloorplanController` in v1.8:

```python
from tdw.floorplan_controller import FloorplanController

c = FloorplanController()
c.communicate(c.get_scene_init_commands(scene="1a", layout=0))
```

`Floorplan` in v1.9:

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller
from tdw.add_ons.floorplan import Floorplan

c = Controller()
f = Floorplan()
f.init_scene(scene="1a", layout=0)
c.add_ons.append(f)
c.communicate([])
```

### B. Replaced `DebugController` with `Logger` add-on

The `Logger` add-on is much more versatile; it can be appended to any controller.

`DebugController` in v1.8:

```python
from tdw.debug_controller import DebugController
c = DebugController()
c.start()
```

`Logger` in v1.9:

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller
from tdw.add_ons.logger import Logger

c = Controller()
c.add_ons.append(Logger(record=True, path="out"))
c.communicate([])
```

### C. Replaced `KeyboardController` with `Keyboard` add-on

The `Keyboard` add-on is much more versatile; it can be appended to any controller.

`KeyboardController` in v1.8:

```python
from tdw.keyboard_controller import KeyboardController

def stop():
    global done
    done = True
    c.communicate({"$type": "terminate"})

done = False
c = KeyboardController()
c.start()

c.listen(key="esc", function=stop)

while not done:
    c.communicate([])
```

`Keyboard` in v1.9:

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller
from tdw.add_ons.keyboard import Keyboard

def stop():
    global done
    done = True
    c.communicate({"$type": "terminate"})
    
done = False
c = Controller()

keyboard = Keyboard()
keyboard.listen(key="esc", function=stop)
c.add_ons.append(keyboard)

while not done:
    c.communicate([])
```

### E. Removed `TransformInitData`, `RigidbodyInitData`, and `AudioInitData`

These were tricky to use and unintuitive (because `AudioInitData` didn't actually load any audio data). They have been replaced with `Controller.get_add_physics_object()`.

In v1.8:

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller
from tdw.tdw_utils import TDWUtils
from tdw.object_init_data import AudioInitData


c = Controller()
c.start()
commands = [TDWUtils.create_empty_room(12, 12)]
a = AudioInitData(name="rh10",
                  position={"x": 0, "y": 0, "z": 0},
                  rotation={"x": 0, "y": 0, "z": 0})
object_id, object_commands = a.get_commands()
commands.extend(object_commands)
c.communicate(commands)
```

In v1.9:

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller
from tdw.tdw_utils import TDWUtils

c = Controller()
object_id = c.get_unique_id()
commands = [TDWUtils.create_empty_room(12, 12)]
commands.extend(c.get_add_physics_object(model_name="rh10",
                                         position={"x": 0, "y": 0, "z": 0},
                                         rotation={"x": 0, "y": 0, "z": 0},
                                         object_id=object_id))
c.communicate(commands)
```

### F. Other changes

- Moved audio classes `AudioMaterial`, `Base64Sound` and `Modes` from `tdw.py_impact` to `tdw.physics_audio.audio_material`, `tdw.physics_audio.base64_sound`, and `tdw.physics_audio.modes`
- Renamed `ObjectInfo` to `ObjectAudioStatic` and moved it from `tdw.py_impact` to `tdw.physics_audio.object_audio_static`
- Moved `AudioUtils` from `tdw.tdw_utils` to `tdw.audio_utils`
- Moved `QuaternionUtils` from `tdw.tdw_utils` to `tdw.quaternion_utils`
- Moved `tdw.flex.fluid_types.FluidType` to `tdw.flex_data.fluid_type.FluidType`
- Removed `tdw.flex.fluid_types.FluidTypes` Default fluid type data is now stored in a dictionary: `tdw.flex_data.fluid_type.FLUID_TYPES`

***

## 6. Changes to the Command API

### A. Renamed `send_environments` to `send_scene_regions`

This change was made because the idiom of multiple environments no longer meaningfully exists in TDW; there are scenes, and scenes have one or more rectangular regions.

Additionally, renamed `Environments` output data (ID `"envi"`) to `SceneRegions` (ID `"sreg"`)

In v1.8:

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller
from tdw.output_data import OutputData, Environments

c = Controller()
resp = c.communicate([c.get_add_scene(scene_name="floorplan_1a"),
                      {"$type": "send_environments"}])
for i in range(len(resp) - 1):
    r_id = OutputData.get_data_type_id(resp[i])
    if r_id == "envi":
        environments = Environments(resp[i])
        for j in range(environments.get_num()):
            environment_id = environments.get_id(j)
            environment_center = environments.get_center(j)
            environment_bounds = environments.get_bounds(j)
            print(environment_id, environment_center, environment_bounds)
```

In v1.9:

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller
from tdw.output_data import OutputData, SceneRegions

c = Controller()
resp = c.communicate([c.get_add_scene(scene_name="floorplan_1a"),
                      {"$type": "send_scene_regions"}])
for i in range(len(resp) - 1):
    r_id = OutputData.get_data_type_id(resp[i])
    if r_id == "sreg":
        scene_regions = SceneRegions(resp[i])
        for j in range(scene_regions.get_num()):
            region_id = scene_regions.get_id(j)
            region_center = scene_regions.get_center(j)
            region_bounds = scene_regions.get_bounds(j)
            print(region_id, region_center, region_bounds)
```

### B. Refactored Flex API

- Renamed `create_flex_fluid_object` to `set_flex_fluid_actor`
- Renamed `create_flex_fluid_source_actor` to `set_flex_source_actor`
- Removed Flex commands for moving and rotating objects; instead of using these, you should move and teleport objects before adding Flex actors:
  - `rotate_flex_object_by`
  - `rotate_flex_object_by_quaternion`
  - `rotate_flex_object_to`
  - `teleport_and_rotate_flex_object`
  - `teleport_flex_object`


### C. Split rigidbody output data into dynamic data and static data

Previously, `Rigidbodies` output data included  dynamic data such as velocity that can change per-frame and static data such as mass that isn't expected to change per frame.

Now, that data has been split into dynamic and static output data types. `Rigidbodies` contains dynamic data and can be requested with `send_rigidbodies`. `StaticRigidbodies` contains static data and can be requested with `send_static_rigidbodies`.

In v1.8:

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller
from tdw.tdw_utils import TDWUtils
from tdw.output_data import OutputData, Rigidbodies

c = Controller()
c.start()
resp = c.communicate([TDWUtils.create_empty_room(12, 12),
                      c.get_add_object(model_name="iron_box",
                                       position={"x": 0, "y": 3, "z": 0},
                                       object_id=c.get_unique_id()),
                      {"$type": "send_rigidbodies",
                       "frequency": "always"}])

for i in range(len(resp) - 1):
    r_id = OutputData.get_data_type_id(resp[i])
    if r_id == "rigi":
        rigi = Rigidbodies(resp[i])
        for j in range(rigi.get_num()):
            object_id = rigi.get_id(j)
            velocity = rigi.get_velocity(j)
            angular_velocity = rigi.get_angular_velocity(j)
            sleeping = rigi.get_sleeping(j)
            mass = rigi.get_mass(j)
            kinematic = rigi.get_kinematic(j)
```

In v1.9:

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller
from tdw.tdw_utils import TDWUtils
from tdw.add_ons.py_impact import PyImpact
from tdw.add_ons.audio_initializer import AudioInitializer
from tdw.add_ons.physics_audio_recorder import PhysicsAudioRecorder
from tdw.backend.paths import EXAMPLE_CONTROLLER_OUTPUT_PATH

c = Controller()
py_impact = PyImpact()
audio = AudioInitializer(avatar_id="a")
recorder = PhysicsAudioRecorder(max_frames=1000)
c.add_ons.extend([audio, py_impact, recorder])
commands = [TDWUtils.create_empty_room(12, 12)]
commands.extend(TDWUtils.create_avatar(position={"x": 0, "y": 2, "z": 2},
                                       look_at={"x": 0, "y": 0, "z": 0},
                                       avatar_id="a"))
commands.extend(c.get_add_physics_object(model_name="vase_02",
                                         object_id=0,
                                         position={"x": 0, "y": 2, "z": 0}))
recorder.start(path=EXAMPLE_CONTROLLER_OUTPUT_PATH.joinpath("py_impact/audio.wav"))
c.communicate(commands)
while recorder.recording:
    c.communicate([])
c.communicate({"$type": "terminate"})
```

### D. `play_audio_data` and `play_point_source_data` now have a `position` parameter

By default, audio sources are no longer parented to objects. The `id` parameter is now a unique identifier for the audio source rather than an object ID. The `position` parameter sets the position of the audio source.

To parent an audio source to a TDW object, send `parent_audio_source_to_object`.

### E. Refactored painting API

"Paintings" are now "textured quads".

| v1.8                              | v1.9                                                   |

| `set_painting_texture`            | `set_textured_quad`                                    |
| `show_painting`                   | `show_textured_quad`                                   |
| `teleport_painting`               | `teleport_textured_quad`                               |

### F. Other changes

- Renamed parameter `env_id` in `set_reverb_space_simple` and `set_reverb_space_expert` to `region_id`
- Removed `set_proc_gen_reflection_probe`. This has been replaced with `enable_reflection_probes`.

***

## 7. Changes to avatars

### A. Adjusted `A_Simple_Body`

The bodies of `A_Simple_Body` were centered at the position of the avatar rather than halfway above. This meant that if the avatar was created at (0, 0, 0), its body would appear halfway through the floor and then "pop" up. Now, the bodies are positioned at (0, 0.5, 0) so that the avatar's pivot is at its bottom-center (just like objects in TDW).

Additionally, the cube body of `A_Simple_Body` required far more torque to turn than the other bodies. Now, it has a capsule collider, allowing it to spin easier.

## 8. Changes to controllers in the repo

### A. Removed `single_object.py`

`single_object.py` and `multi_env.py` have been removed from the repo and have been replaced with [`tdw_image_dataset`](https://github.com/alters-mit/tdw_image_dataset), a separate repo. `ImageDataset` is very similar to `SingleObject` with two notable changes:

1. It is better organized for users to create subclasses.
2. It replaces `IdPassGrayscale` data with `Occlusion` data, which is overall faster and somewhat less error prone.

### B. Rewrote all example controllers

All example controllers have either been rewritten or removed. There are *many* new examples and they are grouped by documentation lesson. [See here.](https://github.com/threedworld-mit/tdw/tree/master/Python/example_controllers)

## 9. Changes to external repos

### A. Upgraded Magnebot to 2.0.0

[Magnebot 2 is a rewrite of Magnebot.](https://github.com/alters-mit/magnebot) The Magnebot is now an add-on that can be added to any TDW controller. It can still be optionally used as a controller like in earlier versions.

### B. Upgraded asset_bundle_creator to 1.4.0

To upgrade:

1. Delete this folder if it exists: `~/asset_bundle_creator`
2. Install Unity 2020.3.24f1 via Unity Hub

The next time you create a model asset bundle, the `asset_bundle_creator` project will be recreated.

### C. Upgraded robot_creator to 1.1.0

To upgrade:

1. Delete this folder if it exists: `~/robot_creator`
2. Install Unity 2020.3.24f1 via Unity Hub

The next time you create a robot asset bundle, the `robot_creator` project will be re-cloned.

### D. Upgraded tdw_physics to 0.4.0

[tdw_physics](https://github.com/alters-mit/tdw_physics) is now compatible with TDW v1.9.0

To upgrade: `git pull`

## 10. Updated Unity Engine

Updated Unity Engine from 2020.2.7f1 to 2020.3.24f1. This update is *very* unlikely to affect simulation behavior; let us know if it does.

If you have access to the TDWBase repo, you need to use Unity 2020.3.24f1 instead of Unity 2020.2.7f1.
