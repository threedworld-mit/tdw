##### Replicants

# Actions

The `Replicant` has a pre-defined action space, divided into separate function calls:

- `turn_by(angle)`
- `turn_to(target)`
- `move_by(distance)`
- `move_to(target)`
- `reach_for(target, arm)`
- `reset_arm(arm)`
- `grasp(target, arm)`
- `drop(arm)`
- `animate(animation)`
- `look_at(target)`
- `rotate_head(angle, axis)`
- `reset_head()`

Calling one of these action functions will *start* the action but won't actually *do* the action. This means that Replicants can move concurrently in a [multi-agent simulation](../multi_agent/overview.md).

This example doesn't actually do anything:

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller
from tdw.tdw_utils import TDWUtils
from tdw.add_ons.replicant import Replicant

c = Controller()
replicant = Replicant()
c.add_ons.append(replicant)
c.communicate(TDWUtils.create_empty_room(12, 12))

# This doesn't do anything!
replicant.move_by(2)
```

All actions require multiple `communicate()` calls to complete.

In this example, we'll tell the Replicant to walk 2 meters forward. We'll also add a [camera](../core_concepts/add_ons.md) to the scene and enable [image capture](../core_concepts/images.md). Note that this example is *not* an optimal way to use a Replicant and that subsequent examples will fix some na√Øve assumptions we're making. 

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller
from tdw.tdw_utils import TDWUtils
from tdw.add_ons.replicant import Replicant
from tdw.add_ons.third_person_camera import ThirdPersonCamera
from tdw.add_ons.image_capture import ImageCapture
from tdw.backend.paths import EXAMPLE_CONTROLLER_OUTPUT_PATH

c = Controller()
replicant = Replicant(position={"x": 0, "y": 0, "z": 2})
camera = ThirdPersonCamera(position={"x": 2, "y": 1.6, "z": 1},
                           look_at=replicant.replicant_id,
                           avatar_id="a")
path = EXAMPLE_CONTROLLER_OUTPUT_PATH.joinpath("move_by")
print(f"Images will be saved to: {path}")
capture = ImageCapture(avatar_ids=["a"],
                       path=path)
# Note the order in which the add-ons are added. The replicant needs to be first so that the camera can look at it.
c.add_ons.extend([replicant, camera, capture])
# Create the scene.
c.communicate(TDWUtils.create_empty_room(12, 12))
# Start walking.
replicant.move_by(2)
# Loop for a while.
for i in range(100):
    c.communicate([])
c.communicate({"$type": "terminate"})
```

Result:

## Framerate

This first "problem" with the above example is that the framerate is fast (it's been slowed down in the .gif). This is desirable in the context of machine learning, where the simulation *should* be faster than realtime, but for the sake of a video, we might want to slow time by sending [`set_target_framerate`](../../api/command_api.md#set_target_framerate):

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller
from tdw.tdw_utils import TDWUtils
from tdw.add_ons.replicant import Replicant
from tdw.add_ons.third_person_camera import ThirdPersonCamera
from tdw.add_ons.image_capture import ImageCapture
from tdw.backend.paths import EXAMPLE_CONTROLLER_OUTPUT_PATH

c = Controller()
replicant = Replicant(position={"x": 0, "y": 0, "z": 2})
camera = ThirdPersonCamera(position={"x": 2, "y": 1.6, "z": 1},
                           look_at=replicant.replicant_id,
                           avatar_id="a")
path = EXAMPLE_CONTROLLER_OUTPUT_PATH.joinpath("move_by")
print(f"Images will be saved to: {path}")
capture = ImageCapture(avatar_ids=["a"],
                       path=path)
# Note the order in which the add-ons are added. The replicant needs to be first so that the camera can look at it.
c.add_ons.extend([replicant, camera, capture])
# Create the scene. Set the framerate.
c.communicate([TDWUtils.create_empty_room(12, 12),
               {"$type": "set_target_framerate",
                "framerate": 30}])
# Start walking.
replicant.move_by(2)
# Loop for a while.
for i in range(100):
    c.communicate([])
c.communicate({"$type": "terminate"})
```

The rest of the tutorial will assume that you want to use the Replicant in machine-learning context, as opposed to a video-generation context, and therefore the example code will omit the `set_target_framerate` command.

## Action Status

A more significant problem with the initial action is the loop we're using; we're not checking for when the action actually ends, or if it succeeds.

In the case of `move_by(distance)`, the action can end in success (the Replicant walked the target distance), or failure ([a collision or near-collision](movement.md)).

Within the add-on, every action is a data object: `replicant.action`. This is a subclass of [`Action`](../../python/replicant/actions/action.md).

When we call `replicant.move_by(distance)`, we actually set the `replicant.action` field, like this:

```
        self.action = MoveBy(distance=distance,
                             dynamic=self.dynamic,
                             collision_detection=self.collision_detection,
                             previous=self._previous_action,
                             reset_arms=reset_arms,
                             reset_arms_duration=reset_arms_duration,
                             arrived_at=arrived_at,
                             max_walk_cycles=max_walk_cycles)
```

The [`Action`](../../python/replicant/actions/action.md) (in this case, a [`MoveBy`](../../python/replicant/actions/move_by.md) action), has a `status` field. While the action is ongoing, `action.status == ActionStatus.ongoing`. If it is ever something else, we know that the action is done.

This example replaces the `for i in range(100):` loop with a `while` loop that continuously checks the action's status for completion. Note that there is an additional, `c.communicate([])` call at the end; this is to send commands that end the action.

```python
from tdw.controller import Controller
from tdw.tdw_utils import TDWUtils
from tdw.add_ons.replicant import Replicant
from tdw.add_ons.third_person_camera import ThirdPersonCamera
from tdw.add_ons.image_capture import ImageCapture
from tdw.backend.paths import EXAMPLE_CONTROLLER_OUTPUT_PATH
from tdw.replicant.action_status import ActionStatus

c = Controller()
replicant = Replicant(position={"x": 0, "y": 0, "z": 2})
camera = ThirdPersonCamera(position={"x": 2, "y": 1.6, "z": 1},
                           look_at=replicant.replicant_id,
                           avatar_id="a")
path = EXAMPLE_CONTROLLER_OUTPUT_PATH.joinpath("move_by")
print(f"Images will be saved to: {path}")
capture = ImageCapture(avatar_ids=["a"],
                       path=path)
# Note the order in which the add-ons are added. The replicant needs to be first so that the camera can look at it.
c.add_ons.extend([replicant, camera, capture])
# Create the scene. Set the framerate.
c.communicate(TDWUtils.create_empty_room(12, 12))
# Start walking.
replicant.move_by(2)
# Continue walking until the action ends.
while replicant.action.status == ActionStatus.ongoing:
    c.communicate([])
# End the action.
c.communicate([])
print(replicant.action.status)
c.communicate({"$type": "terminate"})
```

Result:

```
ActionStatus.success
```

It is *not* necessary to wrap all Replicant actions in a loop like this. For example, in the context of a multi-agent simulation you won't want to loop like this because you'll want to be checking multiple agent actions at the same time. For the sake of subsequent example code, we know we have only one agent, so this simple loop is good enough for showcasing the rest of the Replicant's behavior.

## Actions and Replicant types

As explained in the [previous document](overview.md), you can set the type of Replicant like this: `replicant = Replicant(name="fireman")`. All Replicant types share the following rules:

 1. **Every action will always work with every type of Replicant.**  In other word, every Replicant can always `move_by(distance)`, `reach_for(target, arm)`, etc. This rule doesn't apply to [Wheelchair Replicants](../wheelchair_replicants/overview.md) because they aren't Replicants and in many cases have similar, but not the same, APIs.
 2. **Different types of Replicants may require different action parameters.** With a few exceptions, actions won't check the physical size of a Replicant. For example, the `reach_for(target, arm)` action *won't* scale the `target` depending on the Replicant's height. If you plan to use different types of Replicants, be prepared to have different target, distance, rotation, etc. parameter values. 

To see an example of these two rules,, you can compare these example controllers: [reach_for_with_plan.py](https://github.com/threedworld-mit/tdw/blob/master/Python/example_controllers/replicant/reach_for_with_plan.py) and [reach_for_with_plan_child.py](https://github.com/threedworld-mit/tdw/blob/master/Python/example_controllers/replicant/reach_for_with_plan_child.py). The controllers are nearly the same but they have different Replicants (adult and child), different object scales (to set the height of the table), and different `reach_for` target positions.

## Low-level description

Actions are very similar to add-ons in that they have a list of commands that can be returned. Actions are handled within `replicant.on_send(resp)`. Thus, the full sequence of how commands are injected into the controller is:

- The `Action` returns a list of commands to the `Replicant`.
- The `Replicant` returns that list of commands to the `Controller`.
- The `Controller` appends the `Replicant`'s commands to the rest of the commands it's about to send.
- The `Controller` sends all of its commands to the build.

Thus, in the remainder of this description, `communicate()` (from the Controller) should be understood as equivalent to `replicant.on_send(resp)`.

### Initialization

Each [`Action`](../../python/replicant/actions/action.md) has an `initialized` boolean. In most cases, this is initially set to False but sometimes will be True, usually because the action fails before it's allowed to begin.

If `action.initialized = False`, the action is initialized on the first `replicant.on_send(resp)` call. The action sets `initialized = True` and then returns `get_initialization_commands(resp, static, dynamic, image_frequency)`, a list of commands which includes the following:

- [`replicant_step`](../../api/command_api.md#replicant_step)
- Depending on the [`image_frequency`](../../python/replicant/image_frequency.md) value, [`enable_image_sensor`](../../api/command_api.md#enable_image_sensor),  [`send_images`](../../api/command_api.md#send_images), and/or  [`send_camera_matrices`](../../api/command_api.md#send_camera_matrices). 
- Most actions will include additional commands, e.g. commands to download and play an animation.

### Ongoing

Actions have a `status` parameter. An action is ongoing if `status == ActionStatus.ongoing`. An action has  ended if `status` is anything else.

It is possible for an `Action` to end immediately after initialization, in which case its end commands are appended to the list of initialization commands (see below).

If the `Action` is ongoing after initialization, then on every *subsequent* `replicant.on_send(resp)` call, it will return `get_ongoing_commands(resp, static, dynamic)`. The commands returned by this function vary depending on the action but always include [`replicant_step`](../../api/command_api.md#replicant_step). In most cases, the action will read `resp` and `dynamic` to decide which commands to send, whether the action is done, etc.

### End

When the action ends, it returns `get_end_commands(resp, static, dynamic, image_frequency)`, a list of commands which includes the following:

- [`replicant_step`](../../api/command_api.md#replicant_step)
- Depending on the [`image_frequency`](../../python/replicant/image_frequency.md) value, [`enable_image_sensor`](../../api/command_api.md#enable_image_sensor),  [`send_images`](../../api/command_api.md#send_images), and/or  [`send_camera_matrices`](../../api/command_api.md#send_camera_matrices). 
- Some actions will include additional commands, e.g. commands to stop an animation.
