    Set whether TDW should use legacy shaders. Prior to TDW v1.8 there was a bug and this command would result in lower image quality. Since then, TDW has far better rendering quality (at no speed penalty). Send this command only if you began your project in an earlier version of TDW and need to ensure that the rendering doesn't change. Initial value = False. (TDW will correctly set each object's shaders.)
