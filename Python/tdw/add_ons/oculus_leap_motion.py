        :param set_graspable: If True, enabled "physics helpers" for all [non-kinematic objects](../../lessons/physx/physics_objects.md) that aren't listed in `non_graspable`. It's essentially not possible to grasp an object that doesn't have physics helpers.
        :param output_data: If True, send [`VRRig` output data](../../api/output_data.md#VRRig) per-frame.
        :param position: The initial position of the VR rig. If None, defaults to `{"x": 0, "y": 0, "z": 0}`
        :param rotation: The initial rotation of the VR rig in degrees.
        :param attach_avatar: If True, attach an [avatar](../../lessons/core_concepts/avatars.md) to the VR rig's head. Do this only if you intend to enable [image capture](../../lessons/core_concepts/images.md). The avatar's ID is `"vr"`.
        :param avatar_camera_width: The width of the avatar's camera in pixels. *This is not the same as the VR headset's screen resolution!* This only affects the avatar that is created if `attach_avatar` is `True`. Generally, you will want this to lower than the headset's actual pixel width, otherwise the framerate will be too slow.
        :param headset_aspect_ratio: The `width / height` aspect ratio of the VR headset. This is only relevant if `attach_avatar` is `True` because it is used to set the height of the output images. The default value is the correct value for all Oculus devices.
        :param headset_resolution_scale: The headset resolution scale controls the actual size of eye textures as a multiplier of the device's default resolution. A value greater than 1 improves image quality but at a slight performance cost. Range: 0.5 to 1.75
        :param non_graspable: A list of IDs of non-graspable objects, meaning that they don't have physics helpers (see `set_graspable`). By default, all non-kinematic objects are graspable and all kinematic objects are non-graspable. Set this to make non-kinematic objects non-graspable.
        :param max_graspable_mass: Any objects with mass greater than or equal to this value won't have physics helpers. This will prevent the hands from attempting to grasp furniture.
        :param min_mass: Unlike `max_graspable_mass`, this will actually set the mass of objects. Any object with a mass less than this value will be set to this value.
        :param discrete_collision_detection_mode: If True, the VR rig's hands and all graspable objects in the scene will be set to the `"discrete"` collision detection mode, which seems to reduce physics glitches in VR. If False, the VR rig's hands and all graspable objects will be set to the `"continuous_dynamic"` collision detection mode (the default in TDW).
        :param set_object_physic_materials: If True, set the physic material of each non-kinematic graspable object (see: `non_graspable`).
        :param object_static_friction: If `set_object_physic_materials == True`, all non-kinematic graspable object will have this static friction value.
        :param object_dynamic_friction: If `set_object_physic_materials == True`, all non-kinematic graspable object will have this dynamic friction value.
        :param object_bounciness: If `set_object_physic_materials == True`, all non-kinematic graspable object will have this bounciness value.
        :param time_step: The physics time step. Leap Motion tends to work better at this value. The TDW default is 0.01.
        :param quit_button: The button used to quit the program as an integer: 0, 1, 2, or 3. If None, no quit button will be assigned.
