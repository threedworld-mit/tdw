## Functions

#### \_\_init\_\_

**`CollisionManager()`**

**`CollisionManager(enter=True, stay=False, exit=False, objects=True, environment=True)`**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| enter |  bool  | True | If True, listen for collision enter events. |
| stay |  bool  | False | If True, listen for collision stay events. |
| exit |  bool  | False | If True, listen for collision exit events. |
| objects |  bool  | True | If True, listen for collisions between objects. |
| environment |  bool  | True | If True, listen for collisions between an object and the environment. |

#### get_initialization_commands

**`self.get_initialization_commands()`**

This function gets called exactly once per add-on. To re-initialize, set `self.initialized = False`.

_Returns:_  A list of commands that will initialize this add-on.

#### on_send

**`self.on_send(resp)`**

This is called within `Controller.communicate(commands)` after commands are sent to the build and a response is received.

Use this function to send commands to the build on the next `Controller.communicate(commands)` call, given the `resp` response.
Any commands in the `self.commands` list will be sent on the *next* `Controller.communicate(commands)` call.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| resp |  List[bytes] |  | The response from the build. |

#### before_send

**`self.before_send(commands)`**

This is called within `Controller.communicate(commands)` before sending commands to the build. By default, this function doesn't do anything.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| commands |  List[dict] |  | The commands that are about to be sent to the build. |
