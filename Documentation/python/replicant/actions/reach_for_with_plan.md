# ReachForWithPlan

`from tdw.replicant.actions.reach_for_with_plan import ReachForWithPlan`

Reach for a target object or position.

This is similar to [`ReachFor`](reach_for.md) but has the following differences:

- There are multiple `ReachFor` sub-actions defined by an [`IkPlanType`](../ik_plans/ik_plan_type.md) value.
- There is no option for an offhand to follow the hand to the target.

`ReachForWithPlan` can be useful when the agent needs to maneuver its arm in a specific way, such as reaching above a surface and then forward.

Within the [`Replicant`](../../add_ons/replicant.md), this action gets used by `reach_for(target, arm)` if the user sets the optional `plan` parameter.

If target is an object, the target position is a point on the object.
If the object has affordance points, the target position is the affordance point closest to the hand.
Otherwise, the target position is the bounds position closest to the hand.

The Replicant's arm(s) will continuously over multiple `communicate()` calls move until either the motion is complete or the arm collides with something (see `self.collision_detection`).

- If the hand is near the target at the end of the action, the action succeeds.
- If the target is too far away at the start of the action, the action fails.
- The collision detection will respond normally to walls, objects, obstacle avoidance, etc.
- If `self.collision_detection.previous_was_same == True`, and if the previous action was a subclass of `ArmMotion`, and it ended in a collision, this action ends immediately.

See also: [`ReachFor`](reach_for.md).

## Fields

- `ik_plan` The [`IkPlan`](../ik_plans/ik_plan.md) this action will use.

- `actions` A list of actions that will be filled in `get_initialization_commands()`.

- `action_index` The index of the current action.

- `status` [The current status of the action.](../action_status.md) By default, this is `ongoing` (the action isn't done).

- `initialized` If True, the action has initialized. If False, the action will try to send `get_initialization_commands(resp)` on this frame.

- `done` If True, this action is done and won't send any more commands.

## Functions

#### \_\_init\_\_

**`ReachForWithPlan(plan, targets, absolute, arrived_at, max_distance, arms, dynamic, collision_detection, previous, duration, scale_duration, from_held, held_point)`**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| plan |  IkPlanType |  | An [`IkPlanType`](../ik_plans/ik_plan_type.md) that will define the [`IkPlan`](../ik_plans/ik_plan.md) this action will use. |
| targets |  List[TARGET] |  | The targets per arm. If int: An object ID. If dict: A position as an x, y, z dictionary. If numpy array: A position as an [x, y, z] numpy array. |
| absolute |  bool |  | If True, the target position is in world space coordinates. If False, the target position is relative to the Replicant. Ignored if `target` is an int. |
| arrived_at |  float |  | If the final [`ReachFor`](../actions/reach_for.md) action ends and the hand is this distance or less from the target, the motion succeeds. |
| max_distance |  float |  | If at the start of the first [`ReachFor`](../actions/reach_for.md) action the target is further away than this distance from the hand, the action fails. |
| arms |  List[Arm] |  | The [`Arm`](../arm.md)(s) that will reach for each target. |
| dynamic |  ReplicantDynamic |  | The [`ReplicantDynamic`](../replicant_dynamic.md) data that changes per `communicate()` call. |
| collision_detection |  CollisionDetection |  | The [`CollisionDetection`](../collision_detection.md) rules. |
| previous |  Optional[Action] |  | The previous action. Can be None. |
| duration |  float |  | The total duration of the motion in seconds. Each [`ReachFor`](../actions/reach_for.md) action is a fraction of this. For example, if there are 2 [`ReachFor`](../actions/reach_for.md) actions, then the duration of each of them is `duration / 2`. |
| scale_duration |  bool |  | If True, `duration` will be multiplied by `framerate / 60)`, ensuring smoother motions at faster-than-life simulation speeds. |
| from_held |  bool |  | If False, the Replicant will try to move its hand to the `target`. If True, the Replicant will try to move its held object to the `target`. This is ignored if the hand isn't holding an object. |
| held_point |  str |  | The bounds point of the held object from which the offset will be calculated. Can be `"bottom"`, `"top"`, etc. For example, if this is `"bottom"`, the Replicant will move the bottom point of its held object to the `target`. This is ignored if `from_held == False` or ths hand isn't holding an object. |

#### get_initialization_commands

**`self.get_initialization_commands(resp, static, dynamic, image_frequency)`**


| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| resp |  List[bytes] |  | The response from the build. |
| static |  ReplicantStatic |  | The [`ReplicantStatic`](../replicant_static.md) data that doesn't change after the Replicant is initialized. |
| dynamic |  ReplicantDynamic |  | The [`ReplicantDynamic`](../replicant_dynamic.md) data that changes per `communicate()` call. |
| image_frequency |  ImageFrequency |  | An [`ImageFrequency`](../image_frequency.md) value describing how often image data will be captured. |

_Returns:_  A list of commands to initialize this action.

#### get_ongoing_commands

**`self.get_ongoing_commands(resp, static, dynamic)`**

Evaluate an action per-frame to determine whether it's done.


| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| static |  ReplicantStatic |  | The [`ReplicantStatic`](../replicant_static.md) data that doesn't change after the Replicant is initialized. |
| dynamic |  ReplicantDynamic |  | The [`ReplicantDynamic`](../replicant_dynamic.md) data that changes per `communicate()` call. |

_Returns:_  A list of commands to send to the build to continue the action.

#### get_end_commands

**`self.get_end_commands(resp, static, dynamic, image_frequency)`**


| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| resp |  List[bytes] |  | The response from the build. |
| static |  ReplicantStatic |  | The [`ReplicantStatic`](../replicant_static.md) data that doesn't change after the Replicant is initialized. |
